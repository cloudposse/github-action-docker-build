Build Docker image and push it




## Introduction

Build Docker image and push it. 




## Usage

```yaml
  name: Push into main branch
  on:
    push:
      branches: [ master ]

  jobs:
    context:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Build
        id: build
        uses: cloudposse/github-action-docker-build-push@main
        with:
          registry: registry.hub.docker.com
          organization: "${{ github.event.repository.owner.login }}"
          repository: "${{ github.event.repository.name }}"
          login: "${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}"
          password: "${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD }}"
          platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64

    outputs:
      image: ${{ steps.build.outputs.image }}
      tag: ${{ steps.build.outputs.tag }}
```
> [!TIP]
> If ommited, `cache-from` and `cache-to` will default to `gha`.
> In an AWS environment, we recommend using [ECR as a remote cache](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/announcing-remote-cache-support-in-amazon-ecr-for-buildkit-clients/).
